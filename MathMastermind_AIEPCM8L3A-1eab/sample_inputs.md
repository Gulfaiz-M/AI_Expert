## Tip for Testing “Alternate Method” + “Verification”
- After solving any equation, ask again:
  - “Verify the solution by substitution.”
  - “Solve using a different method.”

Example follow-ups:
- “Solve 2x² + 5x − 3 = 0 and verify the roots.”
- “Solve the system using elimination and then using substitution.”
